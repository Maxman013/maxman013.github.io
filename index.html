  <p>This is a tool designed to let you get an access token to allow a Facebook bot to autopost. You use this access token in your API requests for authentication purposes. The autoposting uses an app I created on Facebook developers called "PaintBot", so do not be alarmed when your posts say "Posted by PaintBot".</p>

  <h1>Step 1</h1>
  <p>Click </p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/v3.1/dialog/oauth?client_id=164152187588420&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fconnect%2Flogin_success.html&scope=manage_pages%2Cpublish_pages%2Cpages_show_list&state=&response_type=token">here</a><p> to login to the app. Make sure you allow all permissions that have been requested, or else this whole process will not work.</p>
