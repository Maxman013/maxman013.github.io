  <p>This is a tool designed to let you get an access token to allow a Facebook bot to autopost. You use this access token in your API requests for authentication purposes. The autoposting uses an app I created on Facebook developers called "PaintBot", so do not be alarmed when your posts say "Posted by PaintBot".</p>

  <h1>Step 1</h1>
  <p>Click <a href="https://www.facebook.com/v3.1/dialog/oauth?client_id=164152187588420&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fconnect%2Flogin_success.html&scope=manage_pages%2Cpublish_pages%2Cpages_show_list&state=&response_type=token">here</a> to login to the app. Make sure you allow all permissions that have been requested, or else this whole process will not work.</p>

  <h1>Step 2</h1>
  <p>As soon as you log in, copy the URL that you are redirected to (before you are redirected to <p style="font-family:Consolas">https://www.facebook.com/connect/blank.html#_=_</p>) and paste it here:</p>

  <p>Do not worry if you didn't do this in time before the URL changes. You can click the link in Step 1 again and it will redirect to the original link. Once you've done that, click this button:</p>
  <button type="user">Complete Step 2</button>

  <h1>Step 3</h1>
  <p>Choose one of the pages that you admin. This will be the page that the app will autopost to.</p>
  <ul class="pages"></ul>

  <h1>Step 4</h1>
  <p>That's it! Your extended page access token is:</p><p id="output" style="font-family:Consolas"></p>
